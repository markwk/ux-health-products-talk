# My Journey into Digital Health and Quantified Self

----

## Me in 2014/2015.

- Stress out and not flourishing

----

## 2015 was a defining year for me...

> - Life Tracking with wearables and time trackers. 
> - Productivity and Time Management from *Getting Things Done* by David Allen.

### Two Years Later in 2017

<small>Creative, Active, Flourishing</small>

----

### My journey into better health and self started with...



---

### Quantified Self


> - (def.) **Measuring or documenting something about your self to gain meaning or make improvements.** 
> - Related: Self-tracking, Biohacking, Data-driven life...

::: notes

- 2007: Quantified Self is neulogism created by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly, two writers at Wired Magazine.  
- 2008: Wolf and Kelly founded the company Quantified Self with the aim “to help people get meaning out of their personal data” 
- Movement 

#### Definitions of QS: 

- “Quantified Self (QS) is an emerging area of technology that allows consumers to use a variety of digital tools to collect data and learn about their behaviors and habits of everyday life.” (Rocket Fuel Survey, 2014)
- "The Quantified Self (QS) refers to a movement in which its participants track the biological, physical, behavioural, and/or environmental aspects of their everyday lives" (Eiben, 2015)

QS is also become something we do with much of technology but without a specific need to call it out.

### Why Do We Track Our Lives?



-----

### Reserch: Why Do People Self-Track

![](http://www.markwk.com/images/2018-resources/why-people-self-track-graphic.png)

**Primary Motivation for Self-Tracking: Self-Healing**

<small>SEE: http://www.markwk.com/why-people-self-track.html</small>

----

### Lessons Learned:


> - Health is a journey
> - As designers, medical professionals and technology, we need to **<u>empower our users to become actors in their health journeys</u>** (not merely acted about). 



# Key UX and Product Principles



----

### User Experience (UX)

"User Experience" = the entire experience and interactions that an individual has around a product or service.



----

### Human- or User-Centric Design

= we should design products around and for people (instead of teaching people how to use products) 

---



###

> “Human-centered design is a philosophy, not a precise set of methods, but one that assumes that innovation should start by getting close to users and observing their activities.”
>
> <small>Donald A. Norman, Founder HCD</small>



---

### Products should solve user problems.

----

### UX Principles


> - Consider your assumptions. 
> - Talk to real users.
> - Prototype or Build an MVP.
> - Test and validate.
> - Rinse and Repeat via Iterative Design. 



# Building Data- and User-Centric Apps: Two Cases





# Biomarker Tracker

<br>

[BiomarkerTracker.com](http://www.biomarkertracker.com/)

----

- Between 2017 and today, I've done over 30 customer interviews and user tests on protypes in four countries around blood test lab results with the eventual goal of building a biomarker product. 

----

### What is the problem we are solving? 

> - How to understand my blood test results

---

### Why does this matter? 

> - Biomarkers are an actionable metric for understanding and improving our health. 
> - Users want to understand their health journeys with actionable science. 

---

## BiomarkerTracker.com

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markwk/awesome-biomarkers/master/images/biomarker-tracker-for-google-sheets-cover.jpg)

----

### BiomarkerTracker.com

- A research-backed database about blood biomarkers. [github.com/markwk/awesome-biomarkers](https://github.com/markwk/awesome-biomarkers)
- An open source blood test tracker
- On-Going: **A consumer-facing app for understanding, analyzing and tracking health biomarkers**. 



---

### On-Going Challenges: 

- Health apps need to consider larger healthcare environment. 
- Integrating with partners and health data systems. 
- Adapting and individualizing information and feedback to the user and their health journey. 



# QS Ledger

### QS Ledger

[github.com/markwk/qs_ledger](https://[github.com/markwk/qs_ledger](github.com/markwk/qs_ledger))

----

### What is the problem we are solving? 

- Aggregating various personal data sources together
- Enabling DIY data visualization and exploration (and even personal machine learning)

---

### Why does this matter? 

> - Increasingly users don't just want to be told what to do; users want to engage with their own data and personal information (health or otherwise)
> - As designers, we also need to design to **<u>enable sophisticated and personalized product usage</u>**.  

---

### Lessons Learned from QS Ledger:

> - Limitation: Need to be Python User.
> - Users like <u>data ownership</u> and <u>data engagement</u> or having active role in using and visualizing their data. 
> - There is no limit to data integrations and how people want to use and explore their data. 



# Characteristics of Transformative Health Apps
