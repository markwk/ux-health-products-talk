# My Journey into Digital Health and Quantified Self

----

## Me in 2014/2015.

- Stress out and not flourishing

----

## 2015 was a defining year for me...

> - Life Tracking with wearables and time trackers. 
> - Productivity and Time Management from *Getting Things Done* by David Allen.

### Two Years Later in 2017

<small>Creative, Active, Flourishing</small>

----

### My journey into better health and self started with...



---

### Quantified Self


> - (def.) **Measuring or documenting something about your self to gain meaning or make improvements.** 
> - Related: Self-tracking, Biohacking, Data-driven life...

::: notes

- 2007: Quantified Self is neulogism created by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly, two writers at Wired Magazine.  
- 2008: Wolf and Kelly founded the company Quantified Self with the aim “to help people get meaning out of their personal data” 
- Movement 

#### Definitions of QS: 

- “Quantified Self (QS) is an emerging area of technology that allows consumers to use a variety of digital tools to collect data and learn about their behaviors and habits of everyday life.” (Rocket Fuel Survey, 2014)
- "The Quantified Self (QS) refers to a movement in which its participants track the biological, physical, behavioural, and/or environmental aspects of their everyday lives" (Eiben, 2015)

QS is also become something we do with much of technology but without a specific need to call it out.

### Why Do We Track Our Lives?

### Reserch: Why Do People Self-Track

**Primary Motivation for Self-Tracking: Self-Healing**

<small>SEE: http://www.markwk.com/why-people-self-track.html</small>

----

### Lessons Learned:


> - Health is a journey
> - As designers, medical professionals and technology, we need to **<u>empower our users to become actors in their health journeys</u>** (not merely acted about). 



# Key UX and Product Principles



----

### User Experience (UX)

"User Experience" = the entire experience and interactions that an individual has around a product or service.



----

### Human- or User-Centric Design

= we should design products around and for people (instead of teaching people how to use products) 

---



###

> “Human-centered design is a philosophy, not a precise set of methods, but one that assumes that innovation should start by getting close to users and observing their activities.”
>
> <small>Donald A. Norman, Founder HCD</small>



---

### Products should solve user problems.

---

### Products should be intuitive.

----

### Products should enable skilled practice. 

----

### UX Principles


> - Consider your assumptions. 
> - Talk to real users.
> - Prototype or Build an MVP.
> - Test and validate.
> - Rinse and Repeat via Iterative Design. 

---

### UX Challenges in Healthcare

> - Healthcare doesn’t happen in just one place; it's an ecosystem (or even a complex adaptive system) of care.  
> - Multiple users, perspectives and stakeholders.
> - Healthcare hasn't embraced IT or design as heavily as other industries. 
> - Fewer designers and product people as other industries. 



# Building Data- and User-Centric Apps: Two Cases





# Biomarker Tracker

<br>

[BiomarkerTracker.com](http://www.biomarkertracker.com/)

----

- Between 2017 and today, I've done over 30 customer interviews and user tests on protypes in four countries around blood test lab results with the eventual goal of building a biomarker product. 

----

### What is the problem we are solving? 

> - How to understand my blood test results

---

### Why does this matter? 

> - Biomarkers are an actionable metric for understanding and improving our health. 
> - Users want to understand their health journeys with actionable science. 

---

## BiomarkerTracker.com

----

### BiomarkerTracker.com

- A research-backed database about blood biomarkers. [github.com/markwk/awesome-biomarkers](https://github.com/markwk/awesome-biomarkers)
- An open source blood test tracker
- On-Going: **A consumer-facing app for understanding, analyzing and tracking health biomarkers**. 



---

### On-Going Challenges: 

- Health apps need to consider larger healthcare environment. 
- Integrating with partners and health data systems. 
- Adapting and individualizing information and feedback to the user and their health journey.

[github.com/markwk/qs_ledger](https://[github.com/markwk/qs_ledger](github.com/markwk/qs_ledger))

----

### What is the problem we are solving? 

- Aggregating various personal data sources together
- Enabling DIY data visualization and exploration (and even personal machine learning)

---

### What do users want?

### What do users want? 

![](http://www.markwk.com/images/2019-resources/quantified-self-google-data-studio-year-in-review-02.jpg)

---

### Why does this matter? 

> - Increasingly users don't just want to be told what to do; users want to see and engage with their own data and personal information (health or otherwise)
> - As designers, we also need to design to **<u>enable sophisticated and personalized product usage or skilled practices</u>.**

---

### Lessons Learned from QS Ledger:

> - Limitation: Need to be Python User.
> - Users like <u>data ownership</u> and <u>data engagement</u> or having active role in using and visualizing their data. 
> - There is no limit to data integrations and how people want to use and explore their data. 

---

### Digital Biomarkers

> Digital biomarkers are consumer-generated physiological and behavioral measures collected through connected digital tools that can be used to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. - Rock Health



# Characteristics of Transformative Health Apps

 

### Characteristics of Transformative Health Apps

> - Patient-centered
> - Science-backed
> - Goal-Oriented
> - Data-Driven
> - Personalized
> - Adaptive
> - Integrates with their health journeys.

----

### 

# Conclusion: Transformational Apps and Health 4.0

### 

In product development, we must think not only about our users and their needs but also what is actually feasible to build, both at the moment and in the future using new technologies. 

----

### 

When we build products in the health space, we must consider not only technology but the entire ecosystem of care and host of other challenges. 

----

### Health 4.0 offers a new path forward.



---

### Summary: 

- Health is not about a lack of sickness or disease. It is about health journeys. 
- My personal health journey reflects this as I pursue well-being, flow, and flourishing. 
- UX is all about the user. It's about talking, testing and validating with real users (including ourselves). 
- Products I build enable tracking and a data-driven healthy life.
- Building transformative health products challenges us to build products that **<u>empower users throughout their health journeys</u>**.
